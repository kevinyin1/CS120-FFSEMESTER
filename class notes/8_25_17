Group fo eight bits is a byte.
Four bits is a nibble.
2 HEX digits is a byte
2^10 one thousand
2^20 one million
2^30 one billion
2^24 is approx. 2^4 * 2^20 = 16 million
32 bit = 2^2*2^30 4 billion
Digital systems operate on a fixed number of bits.
Sign/Magnitude Numbers
Two’s Complement Numbers
0: positive
1: negative -> indication is on the left most bit
0110 = 6
1110 = -6
Sign/Magnitude range
[-(2^n-1 -1),2^n-1 -1] 
Two’s Complement Numbers
Msb has value of 2^n-1
-8 4 2 1 
1 0 0 0 -> -8
1 1 0 1 -> -3
0 1 1 1 -> 7
1 0 0 1 -> -7
if adding a positive and negative with complement numbers, you’re fine.
When adding two positive or negative numbers, make sure to check the most significant bit
Incrasing bit width,
Sign-extension:
From a 4 bit to a 8 bit.
0011 -> 00000011
Negative number ex:
1011 -> 11111011
