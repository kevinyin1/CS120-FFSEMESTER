Power density will get even worse
24 core amd epyc 7401p <- some crazy stuff lol
P transistors are always on top
N transistors are on the botton
wires can overlap. A connector is a dot

A logic circuit is composed of:
    - Inputs
    - Outputs
    - Functional specification
    - Timing specification
