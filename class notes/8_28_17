NOT BUFF AND OR XOR NAND NOR XNOR NOR3

Discrete voltages represent 1 and 0
For example:
    - 0 = ground (GND) or 0 volt
    - 1 = Vdd or 5 volts
What about 4.99? is that a 0 or a 1?
What about 3.2 volts?

what is noise?
Anything that degrades the signal
    - E.g., resistance, power supply noise
Example: a gate (drive) outputs 5 V but, because of resistance in a long wire, reciever gets 4.5 V

With logically valid inputs, every circut element must produce logically valid outputs.
